  <p className="max-w-3xl text-gray-500 text-md font-regular leading-8"> I am an end-to-end designer that gets excited about complex problems and tight collaboration. Understanding problems & needs, crystallizing insights, and developing concepts are part of my day-to-day work, and I love it! Also, spending time finalizing designs, prototyping, and testing are some of the best parts of working as a designer. <br />
  I have worked with design for 7 years, with everything from small startups to tech giants as Google and Spotify. I graduated with an M.Sc. in Engineering, with a focus on Interaction Design, which I believe is the basis for my structured way of working and love for difficult problems. I also studied 1.5 years of Business and Entrepreneurship at Hyper Island, which inspired me to focus on team - and personal development. <br />
  I spend a lot of my spare time running or hiking in the woods, painting or reading books. Cooking is also a huge interest. I try to learn new things often, and recently I started to learn pottery!</p>
